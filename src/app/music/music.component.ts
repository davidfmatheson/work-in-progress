I\'m sure that there are funny software developers out there who can also remember the kids\' appointments, and are expert gift-givers. I came to you emotionally undercooked 16 years ago, and you could have taken your talents elsewhere any time in those first 5 years. How do people fall in love in their 20s and stay in love in their 40s and beyond? Maybe we\'re gifted, or persistent, or maybe we\'re lucky. Regardless, I hear this song and feel relieved that we still do the same drugs. ',

I mean, what use is a musical form that communicates directly with mankind\'s heart, anyway? This is the best articulation of the impact you have on me. There\'s a religious imprinting that has happened, some sort of brain-rewiring that causes me to talk, and act, and behave in a way that is infused with empathy. ',

Every day you renew my desperation.',

It also helps that it has a huge catchy riff running through it. I want to make a whole genre out of stupid-lyric songs that make you laugh. I hope, when we get old, that we got food everywhere, as if the party was catered.',
